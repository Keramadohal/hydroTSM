Description: S3 functions for management, analysis, interpolation and plot of hydrological time series, mainly oriented to hydrological modelling tasks. So far, it only works with daily / monthly / seasonal / annual time series. The focus of this package has been put in providing a collection of tools useful for the daily work of hydrologists (although an effort was made to optimize each function as much as possible, functionality has had priority over speed). Bugs / comments / questions / collaboration of any kind are very welcomed, and in particular, datasets that can be included in this package for academic purposes.
